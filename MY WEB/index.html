                <p style="color: #f8f2f4">Hello! My name is Nina, and I come from a small town called Koƒçani. I attended high school at a local gymnasium. I enrolled in this faculty because it has always been my dream, and I believe I am good at it. I am a girl with many hobbies and a great love for art. In my free time, I love to paint. Flowers are also my passion, as you might notice from the design of this website. I adore flowers and cultivate them with great care; I know almost all types of flowers. I love reading books and am a fan of movies, though not of TV series. You might wonder how I decided on this profession since my other interests seem so different, but I manage to create a beautiful balance between what I love and what I am good at and see a future in. In the slides below, you will get to know my skills and the achievements I have accomplished so far.</p>

              <h2 style="color: darkseagreen" >Why I Chose Software Engineering</h2>
                <p style="color: white"> From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology and how it shapes our world. The idea of creating something from scratch that can solve real-world problems and improve people's lives has always been incredibly appealing to me. Software engineering is the perfect field to combine my love for technology, creativity, and problem-solving. It's a discipline that offers endless learning opportunities and the chance to be at the forefront of innovation.

                    Languages I Know
                    C: My first foray into programming, C taught me the fundamentals of coding and problem-solving.
                    C++: Building on my C knowledge, C++ introduced me to object-oriented programming, enhancing my ability to design complex systems.
                    Python: A versatile and powerful language, Python has been my go-to for scripting, automation, and data analysis.
                    CSS & HTML: These languages are the backbone of web development, allowing me to design and structure visually appealing and functional web pages.</p>

                <h2  style="color: darkseagreen"> My Passion and Goals</h2>
                <p style="color: white">
                    Software engineering isn't just a career choice for me; it's a passion. I love the challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction of seeing my solutions come to life. My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and skills, particularly in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. I aspire to work on projects that have a meaningful impact on society, whether it's developing innovative software solutions or contributing to open-source projects.
